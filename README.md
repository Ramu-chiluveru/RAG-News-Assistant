# üóûÔ∏è RAG News Assistant

**RAG News Assistant** is an AI-powered, real-time news query system that combines the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Google Search** and **ChromaDB** for delivering accurate and up-to-date answers to news-related questions.

## üìå How It Works

### üß≠ Flow Overview

1. **User Input**
   - The user enters a news-related question via the Streamlit interface.

2. **Similarity Search (ChromaDB)**
   - The system embeds the query using a sentence transformer.
   - It performs a **vector similarity search** against previously stored queries in **ChromaDB**.

3. **Decision: Retrieve or Search**
   - If a similar query exists (e.g., similarity score > 0.65):
     -Use cached data to respond, or regenerate a response with stored content.
   - If no similar question is found:
     - Use the **Google Search API** (or equivalent web search tool) to retrieve the latest news articles.
     - Parse and embed those results.
     - Parse, embed, and store the documents and query in ChromaDB.
4. **RAG Generation**
   - Retrieved documents are passed along with the user‚Äôs query to a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.
   - The LLM generates a context-aware, natural language response.

5. **Display**
   - The result is shown in a chat-style format.
   - The conversation is stored in session state and optionally persisted.
